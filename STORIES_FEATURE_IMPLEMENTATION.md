## 📋 How It Works

### Story Upload Flow:
1. User clicks camera icon or "Add Story" button on HomePage
2. Opens `Story.kt` activity
3. User can select camera or gallery
4. Image is displayed in preview
5. User clicks "Add to Your Story"
6. Image is converted to Base64
7. Story is saved to Firebase Realtime Database **under user's ID**: `stories/{userId}/storyItems/{storyId}`
8. User returns to HomePage where their story is visible

### Story Viewing Flow:
1. User clicks on **a user's story circle** on HomePage
2. Opens `ViewStoryActivity.kt`
3. **All story items from that user** are loaded
4. Stories display full-screen with 5-second timer each
5. Click to skip to next story item
6. If it's user's own stories, delete button appears for each item
7. Auto-closes after viewing all story items from that user

### Story Expiry:
- Stories automatically expire after 24 hours
- Expired stories are filtered out when loading
- Expired stories are deleted from Firebase when detected
- **If all stories from a user expire, the entire user story node is deleted**

## 🔧 Firebase Realtime Database Structure

```
stories/
  ├── {userId1}/
  │   ├── userId: String
  │   ├── username: String
  │   ├── userProfileImage: String (Base64)
  │   ├── lastUpdated: Long
  │   └── storyItems/
  │       ├── {storyId1}/
  │       │   ├── storyId: String
  │       │   ├── userId: String
  │       │   ├── username: String
  │       │   ├── userProfileImage: String (Base64)
  │       │   ├── storyImageBase64: String (Base64)
  │       │   ├── timestamp: Long
  │       │   └── expiryTime: Long
  │       ├── {storyId2}/
  │       │   └── ... (same structure)
  │       └── ...
  ├── {userId2}/
  │   └── ... (same structure)
  └── ...
```

### **Key Point: User-Based Organization**
- **Each user has ONE node** under `stories/{userId}`
- **Each user can have MULTIPLE story items** under `stories/{userId}/storyItems/`
- **Other users see ONE circle per user**, not per story item
- **Clicking a user's circle shows ALL their active story items** in sequence
- **This is exactly like Instagram's story system**
