# Private Account & Follow Request System Implementation

## Overview
This document summarizes the complete implementation of Instagram-like private accounts, follow requests, and followers/following viewer functionality.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Private Account Toggle**
- Added a switch in the Edit Profile page to toggle between public and private account
- The `isPrivate` field is stored in the User model in Firestore
- Users can change their privacy settings anytime from Edit Profile

### 2. **Follow Request System**
- **For Private Accounts:**
  - When a user tries to follow a private account, a follow request is sent instead
  - The request is stored in Firestore under `users/{userId}/followRequests/`
  - The button shows "Requested" and becomes disabled after sending
  
- **Request Notifications:**
  - Follow request notifications are sent via NotificationHelper
  - Users receive notifications when someone requests to follow them

### 3. **Follow Requests Management**
- Created `FollowRequestsActivity` to view all pending follow requests
- Users can:
  - **Accept requests:** Adds the requester to followers/following collections
  - **Reject requests:** Deletes the request without adding connection
- Access from Profile page menu (three dots icon)

### 4. **Followers & Following Viewer**
- Created `FollowersFollowingActivity` with tabs for:
  - **Followers tab:** Shows all users who follow you
  - **Following tab:** Shows all users you follow
- Click on followers/following counts in profile to view the lists
- Each user in the list is clickable to view their profile

### 5. **Private Account Content Protection**
- Private account posts are hidden from non-followers
- Profile shows "0" posts and empty grid for non-followers
- Only accepted followers can see:
  - User's posts
  - Full post count
  - Post grid

### 6. **Profile Picture Update**
- Users can update their profile picture from Edit Profile
- Options: Take Photo or Choose from Gallery
- Images are converted to Base64 and stored in Firestore

## How It Works

1. User opens Profile page
2. Clicks "Edit Profile" button
3. Toggles "Private Account" switch ON
4. Clicks "Done" to save
5. Account is now private

### 2. Sending a Follow Request:
1. User A views User B's profile (private account)
2. User A clicks "Follow" button
3. System checks if account is private
4. Follow request is created and sent to User B
5. Button changes to "Requested" (disabled)
6. User B receives notification

### 3. Managing Follow Requests:
1. User opens Profile page
2. Clicks menu icon (three dots)
3. Selects "Follow Requests"
4. Views list of pending requests
5. Can Accept or Reject each request
6. Accepting adds to followers/following
7. Rejecting removes the request

### 4. Viewing Followers/Following:
1. User opens their Profile page
2. Clicks on "Followers" or "Following" count
3. FollowersFollowingActivity opens with appropriate tab
4. Can switch between tabs
5. Click on any user to view their profile

## Database Structure

### Firestore Collections:

```
users/
  {userId}/
    - isPrivate: boolean
    - (other user fields...)
    
    followRequests/
      {requesterId}/
        - fromUserId: string
        - fromUsername: string
        - fromProfileImageUrl: string
        - toUserId: string
        - status: "pending" | "accepted" | "rejected"
        - timestamp: timestamp
    
    followers/
      {followerId}/
        - userId: string
        - timestamp: timestamp
    
    following/
      {followingId}/
        - userId: string
        - timestamp: timestamp
```

## User Flow Examples

### Example 1: Public Account (Default)
```
User A → Views User B's profile (public)
       → Clicks "Follow"
       → Instantly becomes follower
       → Can see all posts immediately
       → Button shows "Following"
```

### Example 2: Private Account
```
User A → Views User B's profile (private)
       → Sees "0 posts" and empty grid
       → Clicks "Follow"
       → Follow request sent
       → Button shows "Requested" (disabled)
       → Waits for User B to accept

User B → Receives notification
       → Opens Follow Requests
       → Sees User A's request
       → Clicks "Accept"
       → User A becomes follower

User A → Can now see User B's posts
       → Button shows "Following"
       → Can unfollow anytime
```

### Example 3: Viewing Followers
```
User → Opens Profile
     → Clicks on "834 Followers"
     → FollowersFollowingActivity opens
     → "Followers" tab selected
     → Shows list of all followers
     → Can click on any follower to view their profile
